# macupdatecheck

A macOS utility that scans /Applications and ~/Applications, detects which apps are available as Homebrew casks, and interactively generates (and optionally runs) an installer script. It also consults the Homebrew Formulae API to suggest alternatives and can replace pre-existing, non-brew .app bundles when installing via Homebrew.

## üì¶ Version history
- 1.2 ‚Äî 2025-10-22
  - ‚ûï Added per‚Äëapp skip option for alternative (amber) suggestions in checker.sh, so you can bypass long candidate lists quickly.
  - üÜï Added brewmelater.sh to scan all installed Homebrew formulae and casks, show status (up‚Äëto‚Äëdate/needs update/deprecated), and optionally generate an Ansible playbook (brew_reinstall.yml) to reinstall them.
  - üõ†Ô∏è Prompt handling improvements (avoid unintended actions when no TTY).
- 1.0 ‚Äî 2025-10-01
  - üéâ Initial release of checker.sh with scanning, alternative suggestions, and installer generation.

## Features
- Fast scan of installed apps using Spotlight (mdfind)
- Classifies apps with icons:
  - ‚úÖ Green: already installable/managed via Homebrew
  - ü§î Amber: possible alternatives (suggested via brew search + online API)
  - ‚ùå Red: not available (or macOS core apps)
- Online lookup using the Homebrew Formulae API when local searches miss
- Interactive post-scan flow to choose alternatives and build an installer
- Per‚Äëapp skip for alternative suggestions (‚è≠Ô∏è quickly skip long lists)
- Generates ./brew_app_installer.sh and can run it immediately
- Installer auto-adds Applite for easy app management
- Handles ‚ÄúError: It seems there is already an App at ‚Ä¶‚Äù and prompts to replace the existing app cleanly

## Requirements
- macOS
- Homebrew (brew)
- curl (optional, enables online lookups and better alternatives)

## Quick start
```bash path=null start=null
chmod +x checker.sh
./checker.sh
```

## üîç Example scan output
```text path=null start=null

## üöÄ Example installer output (brew_app_installer.sh)
```text path=null start=null
Updating Homebrew...
==> Auto-updated Homebrew!

Installing casks: visual-studio-code warp applite
==> brew install --cask visual-studio-code
==> Downloading ...
==> Installing Cask visual-studio-code
üç∫  visual-studio-code was successfully installed!
==> brew install --cask warp
üç∫  warp was successfully installed!
==> brew install --cask applite
üç∫  applite was successfully installed!

All requested casks processed.
```

## What the generated installer does
- Installs all selected casks (greens + chosen alternatives)
- Always includes `applite` for GUI management of Homebrew apps
- For each cask, if Homebrew reports ‚Äúalready an App at '‚Ä¶'‚Äù, the script asks to replace the existing app and retries install

### Replace-existing-app flow
- Prompts: ‚ÄúReplace existing app at /Applications/Foo.app with Homebrew cask 'foo'? [Y/n]:‚Äù (Enter defaults to Yes)
- Attempts Finder delete (moves to Trash); falls back to moving to `~/.Trash` or removing the bundle
- Retries `brew install --cask foo`

## How to run only the installer later
```bash path=null start=null
./brew_app_installer.sh
```

## üß∞ Script structure (checker.sh)
- Colors and icons: visual indicators for results
- Prerequisite check: ensures brew is installed
- Installed casks cache: `brew list --cask` once for speed
- App discovery: uses `mdfind` to enumerate .app bundles in system and user Applications folders
- Name normalization (caskify): lowercases, replaces spaces with dashes, strips special chars
- Checks per app:
  1) Already managed by Homebrew (exact token match)
  2) Exact cask available (`brew info --cask <name>`) -> ‚úÖ
  3) Broad local search (`brew search --casks <App Name>`) -> ü§î with candidates
  4) Online exact lookup (Homebrew API: `/api/cask/<name>.json`) -> ‚úÖ
  5) Online search alternatives (`/api/search.json?q=<App Name>`) -> ü§î with candidates
  6) Otherwise -> ‚ùå (with filtering of macOS core apps)
- Post-scan interactive builder:
  - Prompts to create an installer
  - Iterates each amber app‚Äôs candidate list, asking per-candidate:
    - Shows progress as `[x/y] App -> candidate`
    - Default Yes on Enter
  - Produces `./brew_app_installer.sh` and offers to run it immediately
- Installer helpers (embedded in the generated script):
  - `prompt_yes_default`: default-Yes prompt reader using `/dev/tty`
  - `install_cask_with_replace`: wraps `brew install --cask`, detects ‚Äúalready an App at ‚Ä¶‚Äù, prompts, removes old app, and retries
- Cleanup: temporary files removed via `trap`

## üß™ brewmelater.sh

brewmelater.sh scans all installed Homebrew items and helps you rebuild your environment via Ansible.

- ‚úÖ Marks up‚Äëto‚Äëdate items
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Highlights items needing updates (including greedy casks)
- ‚ùå Flags deprecated/disabled items via brew info metadata
- ‚úçÔ∏è Optionally generates brew_reinstall.yml that:
  - Installs Homebrew (if missing)
  - Reinstalls all detected formulae and casks using community.general.homebrew and homebrew_cask

Run:
```bash path=null start=null
./brewmelater.sh
# Answer Y to generate brew_reinstall.yml
```

Example run of the generated playbook (brew_reinstall.yml):
```text path=null start=null
PLAY [Reinstall Homebrew apps] *************************************************

TASK [Ensure Homebrew is installed] ********************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Install Homebrew formulae] ***********************************************
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Install Homebrew casks] **************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=3    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

Generated playbook (snippet):
```yaml path=null start=null
---
- name: Reinstall Homebrew apps
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    formulae:
      - git
      - wget
    casks:
      - iterm2
      - visual-studio-code
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Homebrew is installed
      shell: |
        if ! command -v brew >/dev/null; then
          /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
        fi
      args:
        executable: /bin/bash
      environment:
        NONINTERACTIVE: "1"

    - name: Install Homebrew formulae
      community.general.homebrew:
        name: "{{ formulae }}"
        state: present
        update_homebrew: true

    - name: Install Homebrew casks
      community.general.homebrew_cask:
        name: "{{ casks }}"
        state: present
```

## Troubleshooting
- brew not found: install Homebrew from https://brew.sh and re-run
- No prompts for alternatives: ensure you answered `y` when asked to create the installer; the script reads prompts from `/dev/tty`
- Network issues: online lookups require `curl` and internet access

## Notes
- The script uses `mdfind` for speed; Spotlight indexing should be enabled
- Online API used: https://formulae.brew.sh/api
